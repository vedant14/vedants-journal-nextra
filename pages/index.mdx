# Vedant Lohbare

Hey, My name is Vedant Lohbare.\
I'm a Product Manager, early-bird at Shuru.

- 2 x founding-team (Failed once, second yet-to-be seen)
- I build [side-projects](/side-projects) sometimes
- Paint and write sometimes

## Some things I am proud of

- My [Proof-of-work](/pow)
- My [side-projects](/side-projects)
- Volunteered, taught, raised funds, recruited, sponsored and pretty-much did everything I could for under-privileged children at <a href="https://makeadiff.in/" target="_blank"> Make a Difference </a> for 4 years.
- Stupid decisions but waiting to see how they turn out
  - Left a seat in my dream MBA college to work in a start-up (not so good)
  - Left a job in my dream company to work in a start-up (fingers-crossed)
