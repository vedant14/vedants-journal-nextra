I know I sound old. Like everyone else, I hate to be old and wise.

Social media meme culture made it "cool" to rant about stuff. Everyone who rants is more instantly more relatable. And I took part in this. I mean I have a tag called ["Rants"](https://www.vedantlohbare.com/tags/rants) bookmarked on my site. 

Note: Believe me I'm trying to sound less corny and failing to do with each sentence.

I woke up today dreading to go to work. Working in a startup can be a numbing experience, you experience failure at almost on a daily level. And I've worked in a startup environment for all of my career. This has started to wear me down. 
To put things into perspective just six months ago, I would have considered myself the luckiest if I had gotten the job I have today. 

There are 100 things to rant about in my life. There may be 1000 to be grateful about. Humans are wired to hate losing more than they love winning. I think this translates in some-form over here too, that's why we like to fixate on the wrong stuff. 

Reminder: Believe me I'm trying to sound less corny and failing to do with each sentence.

And Ranting is cool! But I'd rather by happy than be cool. 
Being Happy and Grateful is what I'm going to focus on from now on.
