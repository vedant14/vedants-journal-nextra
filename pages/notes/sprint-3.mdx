Start Date: 7/08/2022 \
End Date: 21/08/2022

Also, i am trying to experiment should I start the sprints on Sunday (as I've traditionally did) or on some other day. Like Saturday or Wednesday.

## Goals for this Sprint

### Health

- [x] Go to cult 10 times (Easiest to do)
- [x] Eat better food (Partial success)

### Work

- [ ] Think about this - how can I make an out-sized impact in my job (Running all day in office leaves no time to think about this)

### Side-Projects

- [ ] Get 100 visits to tiny tea kettle page (Well this is bombing)

### Learn + Creativity

- [x] Read 1 book (I did not finish the book but I did read a lot. And I'll give myself this win because it was pointed out to me that I tend to be too hard on myself:) )
