I have struggling with thoughts of failure lately, and I realised I need to visualise success in a better way in order to achieve it.

So these are the people I find successful and the reasons why

1. Elon Musk

   - Revolutionised space travel, road travel, tunnel travel?, solar energy and is widely regarded as A-Quality shit poster.
   - I don't have ambition to be like Elon, the amount of sacrifice to achieve that is un-imaginable for me.
   - Which is strange I generally regard myself as pretty ambitious human.

2. Manas Saloi

   - Not only is he successful as a product manager, he also writes so well.
   - I like the way he thinks about life and other stuff in general. And he is the main inspiration to start this public journal.
   - To be more like him, I want to write more on product management and life in general.

3. Jon Yongfook

   - Creator of BannerBear.
   - He is earning $30K per month from his side project. I want to do that someday.
   - I want to create a successful side-project that can earn me some side-income without having my time tied to it.

4. Prajakta Koli

   - Has an amazing YouTube channel with at the time of writing had close to 7M subscribers
   - That's a lot.
   - Its funny all of us have a mental [salary scorecard](/notes/salary-scoreboard) and this human here easily earns more than many of the CEOs in the tech industry.
   - I don't think so I want to start a YouTube channel or become an influencer though.
   - Another Youtuber I consider successful is Matt D'Avella.

5. Mithilesh Vazalwar

   - Owns a super successful cafe in my city.
   - Has a YT channel as well. This seems like a common running theme.

6. Arnav Gupta

   - Just look at this [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnavgupta), and tell me you're not impressed. 

6. Random people on r/indianfire
   - People who've fired or have captured enough wealth to fire anytime they want.
