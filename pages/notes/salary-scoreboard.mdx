It is hard to not be consumed by the tech hiring situation at the moment. People are being paid well, very well indeed. 

And yes, it sucks if you are not one of those people. 


As much as I tell people I want to optimise for growth in my 20s, it is certainly difficult to not get affected by the "Salary" number. 

Especially when I am running out of my 20s. But that's a rant for another time.


I am frustrated. Truly. 


A 'friend of a friend' got placed in Amazon at 40LPA! This is how he explained his role to me - 
> Oh! My last month's achievement was that I reduced the response time for one API from 5secs to 3 secs.


## I am **not** trying to take the high road here. 

I want to do great work and some-times that means working for lower pay. 

But to be honest, I envy anyone who is being valued at that kind of number. Which is why it sucks. 

But rambling about it makes it easier sometimes. Sometimes. 

Someday hopefully, I can look back and say I made more good decisions than bad ones. \
As cliche as it is to quote _Steve Jobs_, I don't think this quote of his quoted enough - 
> You can only connect the dots looking backwards.
