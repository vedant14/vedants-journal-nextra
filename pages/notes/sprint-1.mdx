Start Date: 4/06/2022 \
End Date: 18/06/2022

I have completed quite a few sprints this year, but this is my first public sprint.\
Also, i am trying to experiment should I start the sprints on Sunday (as I've traditionally did) or on some other day. Like Saturday or Wednesday.

## Goals for this Sprint

### Health

- [ ] Go to Gym 8 times (recently joined cult so trying to form a habit)

- [ ] Eat salads for Dinner at least 10 times (Moved to Bangalore so will have to re-start my dinner-salad eating habit)

### Work

- [ ] Finish PRD for [Secret work project]
- [ ] Get 3 [Secret work documents] reviewed
- [ ] Complete atleast the 8 one-on-ones with people from other division

### Side-Projects

- [ ] Get clients for a cold warehousing project I am working on
- [ ] Run google ads for a tea brand I want to launch (Yet to figure out the name + domain ðŸ˜…)

### Learn + Creativity

- [ ] Finish 25% of the book - Heads you win (Started it yesterday)
- [ ] Optional - Paint something for the room wall

I'll post a update on the sprints next Sunday and a final retrospection at the end of the sprint.
