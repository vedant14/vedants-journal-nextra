This is difficult to admit. But I don't think I've enjoyed my 20s nearly enough. However, I still have 30% of them left.

I regret not going out more, instead of staying at home reading a book. But I love a good book.
I regret not travelling more. Especially solo travel.
I regret not having enough photos, especially of myself. I don't hate to take photos, I just don't realise I should take more photos. I also delete a lot of photos to "save space" - I sometimes of over-optimise. But I do hate taking photos of myself. I think of all my regrets this is the one that stings the most.

I am not a person who regrets these things, but as I've started consuming instagram again, I've started to think about these things. Maybe delete instagram again and live in denial? :P

Don't know. But I should go out more. and "try" to make some memories.
