I am joining a new startup, as a Product Manager.

This is my second zero-to-one journey.
The first one did not pan out so well, I have good feeling about the second one though.

I'll try to document as much as possible in this tag. 

But for now, I am just trying to figure out why the hell am I leaving a job in my dream company.
