# Sprints

## This is my sprints page

Sprints is a concept that I stole from lenny. I started this excercise in 2021, but over an email with a small group of friends. This time I will do it on a public board.

### Goals for 2022

| **Goals**          | **Why this goal?**                                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Improve Creativity | Lead a more creative and fulfilling life. I like to write, read. Also paint sometimes. |
| Maximise net-worth | I want to retire in my mid 30s                                                         |
| Be healthy         | Self-care is important :)                                                              |
| Be curious         | Become a better at life and at work                                                    |

### Execution

- The excercise itself is pretty simple and is something that every tech person probably is already familar with.
- I have set goals for myself keeping a few themes in mind like creativity, money, health, etc.
- Each yearly goal is then divided in quarterly goals
- I create a sprint with a two week action plan.
- And I do a planning and retrospection for each sprint. Well, I try to.
