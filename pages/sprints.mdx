# Sprints

## This is my sprints page

Sprints is a concept that I stole from lenny. I started this excercise in 2021, but over an email with a small group of friends. This time I will do it on a public board.

### Goals for 2022

### Execution

- The excercise itself is pretty simple and is something that every tech person probably is already familar with.
- I have set goals for myself keeping a few themes in mind - basically healthy, wealthy and wise :P
- Each yearly goal is then divided in quarterly goals
- I create a sprint with a two week action plan. (Public documentation started from 2nd quarter of 2022)
- And I do a planning and retrospection for each sprint. I mean, I try to.
- Follow the [sprints here](/tags/sprints)
